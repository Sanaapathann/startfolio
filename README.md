# Startfolio ⚡  

Startfolio is a learning project, built as a frontend-only experiment while I practice Next.js, TypeScript, and modern UI design.

It’s styled as a fictional SaaS portfolio for startups — a minimal one-page landing site that reimagines how early-stage startups can present themselves. The goal is to learn, experiment, and explore building clean, focused websites.
